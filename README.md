## UX

### Strategy

The main requirements of this project was to create a recipe sharing platform that appeals to a large audience of home cooks. To achieve this, the website needs to be simple to use and understand and also has to look visually appealing. 

### User stories

As a User I want ....

- To view the site from a range of devices with different resolutions  
- To be able to easily navigate the website and find my appropriate section
- To be able to create a profile in which to create and edit my own recipes  
- To be able to delete only my own recipes 
- To view recipes that have been created by other users without signing up
- To be able to search for other user's recipes by keywords

As a Business I want ....

- The landing page to be eyecatching and attractive to entice users to sign up
- The potential to advertise cooking equipment based on the equipment required in the recipe 
- The website to be fully responsive on all devices and browsers to appeal to all users

### Scope

- Home page that encourages users to register with a call to action as the first section they encounter. Also displays a random selection of recipes submitted by other users.
- Navigation bar that persists throughout the entire site. Links to Homepage, Recipe section, login, sign up, logout.
- Form for registered users to use to submit recipe details.
- Functionality for registered users to Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) recipes.
- Recipe section that displays users' recipes as a gallery of cards.
- Recipe section search bar that alows users to search for recipes based on keywords.
- login/signup forms that alow users to access their recipes to edit using a password. 



### Design

#### Framework
I chose to use a bootstrap template to enable me to spend more development time writing the code for the backend of the website. I would then write custom html and css to personalise the website. 
#### Color scheme

I used the website: Coolers to create a color palette for my website. After selecting an appropriate Hero image I could use this to generate a color palette. I wanted the website to look fresh and vibrant to complement the ingredients used in the recipes. 

- E8EEDC Beige
- A37A74 Burnished Brown
- 6A9DB5 Air Superiority Blue
- 698654 Russian Green 
- 2D2F30 Jet
#### Icons
I chose to use Font awesome to provide icons for my Navigation bar titles. 
#### Typography
For this project I chose to stick to two fonts to maintain consistency across the website. These were provided by Google fonts. 

- Quicksand - For titles and headings
- Raleway - For all other text.
